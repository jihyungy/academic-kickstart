	abstract = {Combustion characteristics of a mesoscale burner array have been studied using several diagnostic and analysis techniques. The array was specifically configured to enhance overall combustion stability, particularly under lean operating conditions, by promoting flame to flame interactions between neighboring elements. The 4 × 4 burner array demonstrated stable operations up to 3 kW and is designed to flexibly accommodate wide range of combustion power outputs by scaling the element dimensions or array size. Flame stabilizing mechanisms were experimentally examined using OH, CH, and CH2O planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of premixed CH4 and air flames at operating equivalence ratios between 0.7 and 1.2. A quantitative measure of flame stability was obtained through dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of high speed OH-PLIF images. Lean blow off limits and emissions were also characterized across a wider range of equivalence ratios to better understand mesoscale burner array combustion characteristics. Lastly, combustion experiments using liquid fuel, pentane (C5H12), were also carried out. Marked improvement in combustion stability was observed compared to a single swirl-stabilized flame of similar power output. Results indicate mesoscale burner arrays can potentially serve as flexible and scalable next generation propulsion and power generation systems.},

	abstract = {Combustion stability is an important consideration for many energy systems because of its impact on performance and efficiency. Flame dynamics that govern combustion stability are often complex and difficult to resolve, particularly from experimental data. However, recent advances in postprocessing techniques, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have partially enabled flame dynamic analysis. This study aims to provide a comprehensive measure of combustion stability through a detailed investigation of coherent structures and their energy contents, frequencies, and growth factors from DMD. These results are then correlated to underlying physics and chemistry that drive flame dynamics. Three different data sets were analyzed in this study. Numerically constructed images and OH-planar laser induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF) images of laminar flames were used to characterize stable flame dynamics. OH-PLIF images of acoustically perturbed swirl-stabilized turbulent flames were used to characterize oscillatory and unstable flame dynamics. Acoustic perturbation at various frequencies and amplitudes were introduced using a speaker. Dominant spatial structures and their energy contents in the recirculation zone or shear layer were accurately resolved. Frequencies and growth factors provided good mode-specific stability assessment. Overall, the stability analysis is an effective technique for analyzing flame dynamics and developing more stable combustion systems despite complex interaction between acoustics, fluid mechanics, and combustion.},

	abstract = {The primary aim of this paper is to establish the effectiveness of microwave plasma discharges to improve combustor flame dynamics and stability through minimizing heat release fluctuations. A continuous, volumetric, direct coupled, nonequilibrium, atmospheric microwave plasma discharge was applied to a swirl-stabilized premixed methane-air flame to minimize combustion instabilities. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to postprocess data and extract information on flame dynamics that are usually lost through classical statistical approaches. POD analysis carried out on OH planar laser-induced fluorescence images reveals that even at coupled plasma powers corresponding to less than 5\% of the thermal power output, significant improvement in mean energy content of flames ( 23\%) was observed. The corresponding decrease in heat release fluctuations resulted in improved combustor flame dynamics and flame stability, which was found to be in good agreement with acoustic pressure measurements. In the presence of plasma discharge, an effective decoupling between the flame oscillations and the fluid unsteadiness was established due to the differences in flame stabilization mechanisms resulting in up to 47\% reduction in root-mean-square pressure fluctuations. Thus, effective fluid-acoustic decoupling in addition to the accelerated combustion chemistry due to the nonthermal effects of plasma led to significantly improved combustor dynamics, namely, decreased heat release and pressure fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Minute concentration measurements of simple hydrocarbon gases are demonstrated using near-infrared supercontinuum laser absorption spectroscopy. Absorption-based gas sensors, particularly when combined with optical fiber components, can significantly enhance diagnostic capabilities to unprecedented levels. However, these diagnostic techniques are subject to limitations under certain gas sensing applications where interference and harsh conditions dominate. Supercontinuum laser absorption spectroscopy is a novel laser-based diagnostic technique that can exceed the above-mentioned limitations and provide accurate and quantitative concentration measurement of simple hydrocarbon species while maintaining compatibility with telecommunications-grade optical fiber components. Supercontinuum radiation generated using a highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber is used to probe rovibrational absorption bands of four hydrocarbon species using full-spectral absorption diagnostics. Absorption spectra of methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), and ethylene (C2H4) were measured in the near-infrared spectrum at various pressures and concentrations to determine the accuracy and feasibility of the diagnostic strategy. Absorption spectra of propane (C3H8) were subsequently probed between 1650 nm and 1700 nm, to demonstrate the applicability of the strategy. Measurements agreed very well with simulated spectra generated using the HITRAN database as well as with previous experimental results. Absorption spectra of CH4, C2H2, and C2H4 were then analyzed to determine their respective measurement accuracy and detection limit. Concentration measurements integrated from experimental results were in very good agreement with independent concentration measurements. Calculated detection limits of CH4, C2H2, and C2H4 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure are 0.1\%, 0.09\%, and 0.17\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {The need for more environmentally friendly and efficient energy conversion is of paramount importance in developing and designing next-generation internal combustion (IC) engines for transportation applications. One effective solution to reducing emissions of mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) is exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), which has been widely implemented in modern vehicles. However, cylinder-to-cylinder and cycle-to-cycle variations in the charge-gas uniformity can be a major barrier to optimum EGR implementation on multi-cylinder engines, and can limit performance, stability, and efficiency. Precise knowledge and fine control over the EGR system is therefore crucial, particularly for optimizing advanced engine concepts such as reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI). An absorption-based laser diagnostic was developed to study spatiotemporal charge-gas distributions in an IC engine intake manifold in real-time. The laser was tuned to an absorption band of carbon dioxide (CO2), a standard exhaust-gas marker, near 2.7 µm. The sensor was capable of probing four separate measurement locations simultaneously, and independently analyzing EGR fraction at speeds of 5 kHz (1.2 crank-angle degree (CAD) at 1 k RPM) or faster with high accuracy. The probes were used to study spatiotemporal EGR non-uniformities in the intake manifold and ultimately promote the development of more efficient and higher performance engines.},

	abstract = {Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in internal combustion engines is an effective method of reducing NOx emissions while improving efficiency. However, insufficient mixing between fresh air and exhaust gas can lead to cycle-to-cycle and cylinder-to-cylinder nonuniform charge gas mixtures of a multi-cylinder engine, which can in turn reduce engine performance and efficiency. A sensor packaged into a compact probe was designed, built and applied to measure spatiotemporal EGR distributions in the intake manifold of an operating engine. The probe promotes the development of more efficient and higher-performance engines by resolving high-speed in situ CO2 concentration at various locations in the intake manifold. The study employed mid-infrared light sources tuned to an absorption band of CO2 near 4.3 μm, an industry standard species for determining EGR fraction. The calibrated probe was used to map spatial EGR distributions in an intake manifold with high accuracy and monitor cycle-resolved cylinder-specific EGR fluctuations at a rate of up to 1 kHz.},

	abstract = {A heated rapid compression machine has been used to investigate the autoignition behavior of JP-5 and camelina-based hydrotreated renewable jet (HRJ-5) fuels. Testing was conducted at low temperatures (Tc = 627–733 K), low-to-moderate pressures (pc = 5, 10, and 20 bar), and lean (ϕ = 0.25 and 0.50) and stoichiometric mixtures in air. The HRJ-5 fuel, which is 99\% paraffinic, exhibited greater reactivity than the JP-5 fuel in the form of shorter ignition delays. The HRJ-5 fuel also exhibited transition into the negative temperature coefficient region at a lower compressed temperature (Tc = 675 K) than the JP-5 fuel (Tc = 700 K). Two surrogate fuel blends and kinetic models intended for Jet-A and kerosene-type fuels are evaluated for their ability to predict JP-5 ignition delay times because JP-5 and Jet-A ignition delay times showed close resemblance. The models reproduced the qualitative trend in the data, including an accurate representation of when the negative temperature coefficient behavior appears. The best agreement between the data and predictions was obtained at pc = 5 bar and ϕ = 1.0, but outside of this region, the disparity was often 2-fold or greater.},

Two types of near-wall flows were considered: the side wall thermal boundary layer behind an incident shock wave, and the end wall thermal layer behind a reflected shock wave. These thin layers are imaged with high spatial resolution (15μm/pixel) in conjunction with fused silica walls and near-UV bandpass filters to accurately measure fluorescence signal levels with minimal interferences from scatter and reflection at the wall surface. Nitrogen, hydrogen or argon gas were premixed with 1–12\% toluene, the LIF tracer, and tested under various shock flow conditions. The measured pressures and temperatures ranged between 0.01 and 0.8 bar and 293 and 600 K, respectively. Temperature field measurements were found to be in good agreement with theoretical values calculated using 2-D laminar boundary layer and 1-D heat diffusion equations, respectively. In addition, PLIF images were taken at various time delays behind incident and reflected shock waves to observe the development of the side wall and end wall layers, respectively.

Images behind incident and reflected shocks were taken in the core flow away from regions affected by boundary layers. Temperature measurements from these images were successfully compared with predicted values using ideal shock equations.

The fluorescence spectra are fit to determine the relative contribution of the three species to infer an estimate of fluorescence quantum yield for CO2 that ranges from 2–8×10−6 depending on temperature and excitation wavelength with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.5×10−6. The CO2 fluorescence signal increases linearly with gas pressure for flames with constant CO2 mole fraction for the 10 to 60 bar range, indicating that collisional quenching is not an important contributor to the CO2 fluorescence quantum yield. Spectral simulation calculations are used to choose two wavelengths for excitation of CO2, 239.34 and 242.14 nm, which minimize interference from LIF of NO and O2.

Experiments were performed in the burnt gases of premixed methane/argon/oxygen flames with seeded NO (15 to 50 ppm), pressures of 10 to 60 bar, and an equivalence ratio of 0.9. LIF signals were dispersed with a spectrometer and recorded on a 2-D intensified CCD array yielding both spectral resolution and 1-D spatial resolution. This method allows isolation of NO-LIF from interference signals due to alternative species (mainly hot O2 and CO2) while providing spatial resolution along the line of the excitation laser. A fast data analysis strategy was developed to enable pulse-by-pulse NO concentration measurements from these images. Statistical analyses as a function of laser energy of these single-shot data were used to determine the detection limits for NO concentration as well as the measurement precision. Extrapolating these results to pulse energies of ∼ 16 mJ/pulse yielded a predicted detection limit of ∼ 10 ppm for pressures up to 60 bar.
