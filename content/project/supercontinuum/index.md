Low temperature fuel kinetics is critical to sustainable automotive propulsion systems development. However, existing models do not reliably reproduce realworld outcomes partially due to the limited experimental results.

This sensor is specifically designed to probe specific pyrolysis products that may form during low-temperature fuel pyrolysis. The sensor is based on supercontinuum light source, a broadband laser source capable of ouputing across the entire visible and the near-IR spectrum. This source was mated with a fast spectru-resolving diagnostic technique tor probe absorption spectra of key species present during fuel pyrolysis. The sensor is currently under active development and characterization.
