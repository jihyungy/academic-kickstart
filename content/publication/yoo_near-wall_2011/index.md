abstract: "A quantitative thermometry technique, based on planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), was applied to image temperature fields immediately next to walls in shock tube flows. Two types of near-wall flows were considered: the side wall thermal boundary layer behind an incident shock wave, and the end wall thermal layer behind a reflected shock wave. These thin layers are imaged with high spatial resolution (15um/pixel) in conjunction with fused silica walls and near-UV bandpass filters to accurately measure fluorescence signal levels with minimal interferences from scatter and reflection at the wall surface. Nitrogen, hydrogen or argon gas were premixed with 1–12% toluene, the LIF tracer, and tested under various shock flow conditions. The measured pressures and temperatures ranged between 0.01 and 0.8 bar and 293 and 600 K, respectively. Temperature field measurements were found to be in good agreement with theoretical values calculated using 2-D laminar boundary layer and 1-D heat diffusion equations, respectively. In addition, PLIF images were taken at various time delays behind incident and reflected shock waves to observe the development of the side wall and end wall layers, respectively. The demonstrated diagnostic strategy can be used to accurately measure temperature to about 60 μm from the wall."
