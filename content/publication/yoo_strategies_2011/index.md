abstract: "This thesis was motivated by the need to better understand the temperature distribution in shock tube flows, especially in the near-wall flow regions. Two main ideas in planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) diagnostics are explored in this thesis. The first topic is the development of a single-shot PLIF diagnostic technique for quantitative temperature distribution measurement in shock tube flow fields. PLIF is a non-intrusive, laser-based diagnostic technique capable of instantaneously imaging key flow features, such as temperature, pressure, density, and species concentration, by measuring fluorescence signal intensity from laser-excited tracer species. This study performed a comprehensive comparison of florescence tracers and excitation wavelengths to determine the optimal combination for PLIF imaging in shock tube flow applications. Excitation of toluene at 248nm wavelength was determined to be the optimal strategy due to the resulting high temperature sensitivity and fluorescence signal level, compared to other ketone and aromatic tracers at other excitation wavelengths. Sub-atmospheric toluene fluorescence yield data was measured to augment the existing photophysical data necessary for this diagnostic technique. In addition, a new imaging test section was built to allow PLIF imaging in all regions of the shock tube test section, including immediately adjacent to the side and end walls. The signal-to-noise (SNR) and spatial resolution of the PLIF images were optimized using statistical analysis. Temperature field measurements were made with the PLIF diagnostic technique across normal incident and reflected shocks in the shock tube core flow. The resulting images show uniform spatial distribution, and good agreement with conditions calculated from the normal shock jump equations. Temperature measurement uncertainty is about 3.6% at 800K. The diagnostic was also applied to image flow over a wedge. The resulting images capture all the flow features predicted by numerical simulations. The second topic is the development of a quantitative near-wall diagnostic using tracer-based PLIF imaging. Side wall thermal boundary layers and end wall thermal layers are imaged to study the temperature distribution present under constant pressure conditions. The diagnostic technique validated in the shock tube core flow region was further optimized to improve near-wall image quality. The optimization process considered various wall materials, laser sheet orientations, camera collection angles, and optical components to find the configuration that provides the best images. The resulting images have increased resolution (15um) and are able to resolve very thin non-uniform near-wall temperature layers (down to 60um from the surface). The temperature field and thickness measurements of near-wall shock tube flows under various shock conditions and test gases showed good agreement with boundary layer theory. To conclude this thesis, new applications and future improvements to the developed PLIF diagnostic technique are discussed. These suggested refinements can provide an even more robust and versatile PLIF imaging technique capable of measuring a wider range of flow conditions near walls."
